odoo-tools
===============

Tools for odoo (v8.0 and up) and OpenERP (v7.0) for the Ubuntu LTS Server Linux Distribution

The main focus is to

- prepare the system (install and check all the dependencies)
- install the instance (setup gitrepo, paths, nginx, postgresql, initd, setup backup-cron-job) 
- backup (easy full or database only backup creation)
